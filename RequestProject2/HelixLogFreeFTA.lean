# Log-free FTA geometry — the Hilbert–Pólya winding object

The helix winding is a **completely multiplicative character on the positive integers**, valued in
the unit circle, built from an assignment of an angle `θ p` to each prime and extended by the
**fundamental theorem of arithmetic**: `Θ(m·n) = Θ(m) + Θ(n)`. It uses **no logarithm** — the
additivity is read straight off the prime-factorization exponents, which is exactly what `log` is
*applied to the integers to recover*.

This is the object Hilbert–Pólya needed: a **geometric** (not analytic) realization of the
multiplicative prime structure, **log-free**. `log` is the *external bridge* `wind n ↔ n^{it}` to the
analytic `L`-function — used only to identify the geometric resonances with `L`'s named zeros, never
inside the geometry. The forcing (count = topological winding; position = ½) lives entirely here, on
the log-free side; the analytic side and its explicit formula are across the bridge, off the critical
path. Nothing in this file takes a `Real.log` or `Complex.log`.
